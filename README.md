# KMeans Clustering for Mall Customers
This project demonstrates the application of KMeans clustering on the "mall_customers.csv" dataset to segment customers based on their annual income and spending score.
# Objective
The key aim of this project is to investigate customer segmentation using unsupervised learning methods, focused specifically on KMeans clustering, where a data set consisting information about customer annual income and spending scores from 1 - 100 is used.
# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is "mall_customers.csv." It contains the following columns:
+ CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer
+ Gender: Gender of the customer
+ Age: Age of the customer
+ Annual Income (k$): Annual income of the customer
+ Spending Score (1-100): Score based on customer behavior and purchasing data
# Approach
The main steps in this project include:

* Data Preprocessing: Exploring the dataset,encoding categorical variables.
* KMeans Clustering: Using the KMeans algorithm to group customers based on their annual income and spending score.
* Visualization: Visualizing the clusters to understand the distinct customer segments.
# Files
+ mall_customers.csv: The dataset used for clustering.
+ KMeans_Clustering.ipynb: Google collab and Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for KMeans clustering.
+ README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project.
# Conclusion
The outcome of this undertaking will involve acquiring charts that can illustrate the formations of the clusters with reference to the yearly returns and savings ranking; hence assist to pick out separate client divisions for marketing campaigns that can be easily targeted.
